# Crop_price_prediction
Crop Price Prediction uses machine learning to forecast crop prices based on historical data, weather, market trends, and other factors. This project aids farmers and stakeholders in making informed decisions to maximize profits and reduce risks. Techniques include regression models, time-series analysis, and feature engineering.
# Problem Staatement
Development of AIML based models for predicting prices of agri-horticultural commodities such as pulses and vegetables(onion, potato, onion).
# Proposed Solution
--> Developing a Crop Price Prediction model which helps farmers anticipate future crop prices by Machine Learning.                             
--> Our solution combines data from various resources like government websites to train the model. The resulting predictions are displayed on a user-friendly platform where farmers can 
    easily access & interpret prices.
--> The prototype is a web-based platform users input crop details and receive real-time price predictions.
